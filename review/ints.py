
# an 'int' is a variable type that stores whole numbers
int1 = 2
int2 = 6

# you can do math with ints
addition = int1 + int2 # 8
subtraction = int2 - int1 # 4
multiplication = int1 * int2 # 12
division = int2 / int1 # 3

# you can also convert strings to ints...
print int("3") + int("4") # prints 7, after converting the two strings into numbers

# ...but only if the string is a number
print int("seven") # this is an error, and Python won't let you do it
